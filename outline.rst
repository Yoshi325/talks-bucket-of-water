*******
Summary
*******

Information Security is a galvanizing term. It carries much power, and therefore, much responsibility. It can be hard to obtain buy-in for long term security needs from Management. And with all the vulerabilities cropping up every day, the pressure to "be secure" can be overwhelming.


*******
Summary
*******

How can a lone developer make a difference? This talk is all about the second half of its title. Common security concerns will be reviewed, then addressed with a focus on what can be done when faced with them or how to avoid them in the first place. The whole world is burning. But you can make a difference.

Transport
*********

* SSL is broken
* Use TLS, 1.2 if possible


***********************

Certificates are Expensive!
***************************

* Money


*************
Let's Encrypt
*************

`Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority. <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
How about Free?

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Any Cons?

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Domain Validation

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
What if I need better?

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Buy extended validation (EV) certificates for public web servers.

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Yes, the are expensive.


******
Access
******

* Identity
* Authentication
* Authorization


********
Identity
********

Often, username.


**************
Authentication
**************

Validation of the right to use an identity.


*************
Authorization
*************

Validation of an identity's right to use a resource.


***********************
TLS Client Certificates
***********************

* Rare, but useful.
* After install, seemless authentication.


*************************
HTTP Basic Authentication
*************************

* Two-step process to authenticate.
* At the webserver level.
* Secured by TLS.
* Username & Password are Base64 Encoded.
* Not the best choice for users.


**************************
HTTP Digest Authentication
**************************

* Multi-step process to authenticate.
* At the webserver level.
* Secured by TLS.
* Password is Hashed with nonce.
* Not the best choice for users.


*************************
Page Level Authentication
*************************

* Secured by TLS.
* Username & Password cleartext POST.
* Now you have to store passwords.


****************
Password Storage
****************

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Cleartext Anyone?

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Do NOT create your own method

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Do NOT use MD5 (it is fast)


****************
Password Storage
****************

Two Key Points:

* Do use salt (long, unique, and random)
* Do use a cryptographically secure hash


******
SCrypt
******

  | A password-based key derivation function (password-based KDF) is generally designed to be computationally intensive, so that it takes a relatively long time to compute (say on the order of several hundred milliseconds). ~ Wikipedia


******
SCrypt
******

Memory Hard


******
BCrypt
******

  | bcrypt is a password hashing function [...] incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power. ~ Wikipedia


******
BCrypt
******

Time Hard


******
PBKDF2
******

* Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2
* Part of RSA PKCS series
* Time Hard
* Iteration recomendation from OWASP:
  * 64k in 2013, doubled every two years (2,048,000 today)


**********
Which One?
**********

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment

    NIST has issued Special Publication SP 800-132 on the subject of storing hashed passwords.

    Basically they recommend PBKDF2.

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment

    My favorite is SCrypt.

    But any of these are acceptable.

    As are some of the newer kids on the block (Argon2).


****************
Not Your Problem
****************

Maybe you can leverage someone else's auth.

* Facebook
* Google
* Twitter


*******************
Database Encryption
*******************

* MIT CryptDB
* MS SQL Always Encrypted
* Backups in Cleartext?


*****************
Cleartext Anyone?
*****************

* Migration to Encrypted

*********
Migration
*********

Options:

* Force Reset
* Upgrade/Update


******************
Migration: Upgrade
******************

#. Add legacy_password column (BOOL)
#. Upgrade existing hash (double-hash)
#. Handle legacy_password == TRUE

  #. Authenticate
  #. Update with single-hash


******
Hashes
******

  A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. ~ Wikipedia

*************
Crypto Hashes
*************

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
  A cryptographic hash function is a special class of hash function that has certain properties which make it suitable for use in cryptography. ~ Wikipedia

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
  Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication. ~ Wikipedia

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment

    Important!

    There are many applications,

    not all crypto hashes are suitable

    for all applications.


*************
Crypto Hashes
*************

* Do NOT use (for secure hashing)
  * MD2, MD4 & MD5
  * SHA1


**************
Message Digest
**************

Hash


*****************
Message Auth Code
*****************

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
  [...] short piece of information used to authenticate a message [...] ~ Wikipedia

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
  [...] protects both a message's data integrity as well as its authenticity [...] ~ Wikipedia

.. class:: current-visible fragment collapsable-fragment
Key should be shared out-of-band.


****************************
Hash-based Message Auth Code
****************************

Basically, uses a cryptographic hash function to generate a MAC.


***********
Compression
***********

Correct Order of Operations:

#. Compress
#. Encrypt
#. MAC


********************
Symmetric Encryption
********************

Same key at both ends.


*********************
Asymmetric Encryption
*********************

Different keys at each end.

(Uses a key pair: Public and Private)


********************
Symmetric Encryption
********************

* RC4 is right out
* AES
* Not ECB mode of AES
* Key size of 128bits or greater
* CBC for block mode
* CTR for stream mode
* Random Initialization Vector
* Random Key
* Random Padding
* Never reuse Key and IV


*********************
Asymmetric Encryption
*********************

RSA with 2048 bit key or ECDSA/ECDH with 256 bit key


*********************
Pseudo-Random Numbers
*********************

Computers are not good at random.


**********************************************
Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Numbers
**********************************************

Needed for things like the IV.
